## About the author

Hello! My name is Chao Jinwen.
Over time, we have witnessed the gradual warming of the global climate. Facing this progressively deteriorating environmental condition,  I am deeply cognizant of the enormous impact of climate change on our world, especially in terms of agricultural production and food security. These issues not only concern our survival but also affect every aspect of our daily lives. It is this realization that has inspired my passion for delving into this field. I hope to contribute through my research to help address this global challenge.

I warmly invite you to visit my webpage. Here, we will explore together the impact of global climate change on agricultural output in depth.
